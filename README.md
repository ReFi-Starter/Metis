Token Minter DApp on Metis Blockchain
Overview
This repository contains the smart contracts and DApp interface for a Token Minter application built on the Metis Blockchain. The Token Minter allows users to create and deploy custom ERC-20 tokens seamlessly, leveraging Metis's Layer 2 scalability, low transaction costs, and developer-friendly environment.

Features
Token Customization: Users can specify token name, symbol, total supply, and decimals.
ERC-20 Standard: Generated tokens are fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard.
Metis Integration: Deployed smart contracts run on Metis Layer 2, ensuring high performance and low gas fees.
Secure and Audited: Smart contracts are optimized for security and have been reviewed for vulnerabilities.
User-Friendly DApp: Intuitive interface for token deployment and wallet connectivity.
